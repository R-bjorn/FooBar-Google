# FooBar Google Interview

## What is the Foobar Challenge? üßê

> The Foobar Challenge is a coding challenge hosted by Google that can be completed in either Python or Java. I completed the challenge using Python. The challenge has its own server with specific, terminal-style commands.

To add some fun, it‚Äôs space themed. The evil Commander Lambda has kidnapped space bunnies and you must rescue them. Each problem adds more context to the backstory. The problems are of various difficulty organized into 5 levels. Each question must be solved within a certain time limit. More time is given for the higher levels.

Personally, I found the Level 1, 2, and 3 problems similar to Leetcode problems, both in terms of difficulty and structure. The problems were straightforward and rarely required optimizing code for speed. On the other hand, Levels 4 and 5 were more complicated and layered multiple concepts into one problem.

## How to participate in the Foobar Challenge? üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

There are two ways to participate in the challenge:
1. Google extends an invitation through the browser
2. A friend sends you an invitation code

I came across the challenge through the first method. I was Googling ‚Äúlist comprehension‚Äù for a different article, and my browser unfolded to reveal the invitation. I never heard of the Foobar challenge before and was a little circumspect. After verifying this was a legitimate challenge, I accepted.

Needless to say, the element of surprise piqued my interest in the challenge. Not to mention, Google reaching out to me with an exclusive invite definitely gave me a confidence boost as a developer. I saw this as a call to adventure and immediately wanted to devote all my attention to it.

For the second method, you need a friend to send you an invitation code. One invitation code is given after completing Level 2. Another is given after completing Level 4.

**If you are interested in participating in the challenge, let me know.** I have an unused referral code.

## Does Google Use the Challenge for Recruiting? ü§ë

At one point, Google used the challenge to find new talent. You‚Äôll find many people online who had a Google recruiter reach out one or two days after completing the challenge. However, it appears that Google hasn‚Äôt used the challenge for hiring since 2020.

After finishing Level 3, the Foobar server ask if you want to provide your contact info to a Google recruiter. I provided my info, but never heard from them.

Nevertheless, I still believe this challenge is worthwhile. It will expose you to new coding concepts, sharpen your skills, and ultimately, make you a better developer.

## Levels 

> What does the challenge look like? The challenge consists of 5 levels. Each level has different problems and complexity. Each level is progressively more difficult and many of the challenges were math-heavy.
> - Level 1 has one challenge with a time limit of 48 hours (2 days).
> - Level 2 has two challenges with a time limit of 72 hours (3 days) per challenge.
> - Level 3 has three challenges with a time limit of 96 hours (4 days) per challenge.
> - Level 4 has two challenges with a time limit of 360 hours (15 days) per challenge.
> - Level 5 has one challenge with a time limit of 528 hours (22 days).

Solutions could be provided in either Python or Java. I was looking forward to completing this challange and improving my Java problem solving and different approach skills. 

Once you decide to play, you will be redirected to the foobar page and you‚Äôve managed to infiltrate Commander Lambda‚Äôs organization and finally earned yourself an entry-level position as a Minion space station. To start the challenge, you need to request by using request command.
