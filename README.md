# Google Foobar Challange

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81584201/184454649-2f26d813-fc58-4f9b-a719-d1d438821474.png" width=100%>

## What is the Foobar Challenge? üßê

> The Foobar is a invite only coding challenge hosted by google that can be completed in either Python or Java. The challenge has its own server with specific, terminal-style commands. The prize for completing? A chance to be recruited. Once you pass a certain level, you have the option to submit your solutions and personal info to a google recruiter. Getting an interview isn't guaranteed however and not everyone gets a response from the recruiters. However I'd recommend not to focus on that too much and just have fun. If you really want to apply to Google, there's usually easier ways.
> 
To add some fun, it‚Äôs space themed. The evil Commander Lambda has kidnapped space bunnies and you must rescue them. Each problem adds more context to the backstory. The problems are of various difficulty organized into 5 levels. Each question must be solved within a certain time limit. More time is given for the higher levels.

Personally, I found the Level 1, 2, and 3 problems similar to Leetcode problems, both in terms of difficulty and structure. The problems were straightforward and rarely required optimizing code for speed. On the other hand, Levels 4 and 5 were more complicated and layered multiple concepts into one problem.

## How to participate in the Foobar Challenge? üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

There are two ways to participate in the challenge:
1. Getting an invite directly from google. This actually isn't super hard, you need to search for certain keywords like "arraylist java" or "mutex lock" on google multiple times to trigger the invite mechanism. The full mechanism is explained <a href="https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/50841">here</a>.
2. Get an invite directly from someone who is already participating. Each participant, gets a maximum of two invites upon completion of certain levels in the challenge. So if you know someone who's already doing the challenge, you could ask them as well.

I came across the challenge through the first method. I was Googling ‚Äúlist comprehension‚Äù for a different article, and my browser unfolded to reveal the invitation. I never heard of the Foobar challenge before and was a little circumspect. After verifying this was a legitimate challenge, I accepted.

Needless to say, the element of surprise piqued my interest in the challenge. Not to mention, Google reaching out to me with an exclusive invite definitely gave me a confidence boost as a developer. I saw this as a call to adventure and immediately wanted to devote all my attention to it.

For the second method, you need a friend to send you an invitation code. One invitation code is given after completing Level 2. Another is given after completing Level 4.

**If you are interested in participating in the challenge, let me know.** I have an unused referral code.

## Does Google Use the Challenge for Recruiting? ü§ë

At one point, Google used the challenge to find new talent. You‚Äôll find many people online who had a Google recruiter reach out one or two days after completing the challenge. However, it appears that Google hasn‚Äôt used the challenge for hiring since 2020.

After finishing Level 3, the Foobar server ask if you want to provide your contact info to a Google recruiter. I provided my info, but never heard from them.

Nevertheless, I still believe this challenge is worthwhile. It will expose you to new coding concepts, sharpen your skills, and ultimately, make you a better developer.

## What To Expect ? 

> Upon starting you are greeted with a unix shell interface. You can interact with the shell using standard unix commands like "ls", "cat" and "cd". You find a journal entry at the very beginning which explains the situation to you.

A bunny themed Star Wars fanfic story that you have to code your way through. There are 5 Levels with different coding challenges. 

> What does the challenge look like? The challenge consists of 5 levels. Each level has different problems and complexity. Each level is progressively more difficult and many of the challenges were math-heavy.
> - Level 1 has one challenge with a time limit of 48 hours (2 days).
> - Level 2 has two challenges with a time limit of 72 hours (3 days) per challenge.
> - Level 3 has three challenges with a time limit of 96 hours (4 days) per challenge.
> - Level 4 has two challenges with a time limit of 360 hours (15 days) per challenge.
> - Level 5 has one challenge with a time limit of 528 hours (22 days).

Solutions could be provided in either Python or Java. I was looking forward to completing this challange and improving my Java problem solving and different approach skills. 

Once you decide to play, you will be redirected to the foobar page and you‚Äôve managed to infiltrate Commander Lambda‚Äôs organization and finally earned yourself an entry-level position as a Minion space station. To start the challenge, you need to request by using `request` command.

## Grand Finale

At last, you've bested Commander Lambda's evil plans, rescued all the bunnies and saved the galaxy! You are now greeted with a mysterious encrypted message. What could it be?

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81584201/184456330-42051af8-9ab4-4e76-b1d0-7650eb270f9e.jpg" width=100%>

After some ~hacking~ research, I found out it's a simple XOR encryption. The message is XOR'd with my google username and then encoded to base64. So you can decrypt it by reversing this process. Let's use a python script to do just that

```
import base64
from itertools import cycle

message = "L0YAHA0qFhseRk1uQVQOHCwSHEpNTXMCHAUCLBIPGARKdFtTTgs6Bw0IDAgwRl9JSSwVDgITGSdG U1NObhoGDhMIMAgRBQtuX0hKAA48CBYfCyQWBhlGTW5BVBwAJRwLBgQJc01TThwoEQoEFR5zQUlJ SToSDghGQXRGFQYBblNSTUYaPQ9SThM="
key = bytes("Trive11w", "utf8")
print(bytes(a ^ b for a, b in zip(base64.b64decode(message), cycle(key))))

# Output: 
# {'success' : 'great', 'colleague' : 'esteemed', 'efforts' : 'incredible', 'achievement' : 'unlocked', 'rabbits' : 'safe', 'foo' : 'win!'}

```

### Advice 

- **Take your time**. Google gives you plenty of time to finish each problem (Over 20 days in case of the level 5 problem). So there's no need to hurry, research the problems thoroughly and design a optimized solution.
- **Know thy standard library**. For a lot of the combinatorics type problems, the python standard library was absolutely godsend. Don't code up functions that are already provided by Python/Java's standard library.
- **Take a break between problems**. There's no time restriction between problems, so you can take as much time as you want before requesting a new problem. Some of these problems need a lot of time to finish, so don't rush in requesting new problems unless you're sure you have the spare time to invest on it.
- **Do Foobar to learn, not for a job**. Foobar probably isn't the most efficient way to get a interview at google. It's completely uncertain if and when a recruiter will respond. So instead of worrying about that, do Foobar to learn, that way you'll be under a lot less pressure.

## Conclusion 

Foobar is a great way to dip your toes into the world of programmatic problem solving. The whole thing is set up in a way so that you can learn as you go. I personally learnt a lot about Markov Chains, Backtracking and Cellular automata while doing these problems.

And if you need some more motivation, here are all the bunnies you'll be rescuing ;)
